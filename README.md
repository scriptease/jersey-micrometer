# Jersey Micrometer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer)

Jersey Micrometer uses [Jersey 1](https://jersey.java.net/),
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) and
[Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) to simplify gathering metrics for your
JAX-RS resource methods.

Jersey Micrometer is published under the
[Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
It requires at least Java 8.

Jersey Micrometer is a based on [Marshall Pierce](https://mpierce.org/)'s
[jersey-metrics-filter](https://github.com/palominolabs/jersey-metrics-filter)
library which uses [Metrics](https://metrics.dropwizard.io) instead of
Micrometer.


## Installation

Jersey Micrometer is available from
[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|jersey-micrometer).

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.stefanbirkner</groupId>
      <artifactId>jersey-micrometer</artifactId>
      <version>unpublished</version>
    </dependency>


## Usage

If you have a resource class like this:

    @Path("whatever")
    public class SomeResource {
        @GET
        public String get() {
            return "some data";
        }
    }

then by using this library you will get a
[Timer](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_timers) metric generated for the
`get()` method. The timers have two tags:
- `method` contains the HTTP method
- `status` contains the response's status code
- `uri` contains the request path

In this example a timer with the name `http.server.requests` is used. Its tag
`method` has the value `GET`, the tag `status` has the value `200` and the tag
`uri` has the value `/whatever`.

### Installation

The first step is to add this library's module and its prerequisites.
- `ResourceMethodMicrometerModule` is the module for this library.
- `ResourceMethodWrappedDispatchModule` is needed so that method invocation
metrics can be captured without resorting to thread locals or other such
unpleasantness.
- `ConfigModuleBuilder` is used to assemble the config sources for
[config-inject](https://github.com/palominolabs/config-inject). If you just
want the defaults used, you need not provide any config sources, so you can just
call build() as shown. See
[JerseyMicrometerConfig](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer-filter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/stefanbirkner/micrometer/jersey/JerseyMicrometerConfig.java)
for more.
- We also bind a MeterRegistry instance. The binding uses a binding annotation
because it's impolite for a library to insist on an un-qualified binding of a
common type like MeterRegistry. This MeterRegistry instance is what will be used
to house all metrics generated by the library.

```
// in your Guice module
@Override
protected void configure() {
    install(new ResourceMethodMicrometerModule());

    // required for resource method metrics
    install(new ResourceMethodWrappedDispatchModule());
    install(new ConfigModuleBuilder().build());

    MetricRegistry registry = new SimpleMeterRegistry();
    bind(MeterRegistry.class).annotatedWith(JerseyResourceMicrometer.class).toInstance(registry);

    ...
```

### Configuration

At this point, you should now be getting metrics generated for every resource
method. If you want to use annotations to have more control, you can use
[`@ResourceMetrics`](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer-filter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/stefanbirkner/micrometer/jersey/ResourceMetrics.java)
to turn metrics off and on for a class or method. In the case below, the method
would end up having metrics.
```
@Path("somewhere")
@ResourceMetrics(enabled = false)
public class EnabledOnClassDisabledOnMethod {
    // method annotation overrides class annotation
    @GET
    @ResourceMetrics(enabled = true)
    public String get() {
        return "ok";
    }
}
```

You can also make it so that the default is to *not* create metrics for
un-annotated classes and methods by setting the property used in
[JerseyMicrometerConfig](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer-filter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/stefanbirkner/micrometer/jersey/JerseyMicrometerConfig.java).
You can do this via the `ConfigModuleBuilder`'s config stack. Here, we'll use a
simple in-code Map to define properties.

```
Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
config.put("com.github.stefanbirkner.micrometer.jersey.resourceMethod.enabledByDefault", "false");

ConfigModuleBuilder builder = new ConfigModuleBuilder();
// read from a map
builder.addConfiguration(new MapConfiguration(config));
```

## Development Guide

Jersey Micrometer is build with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). If you want
to contribute code then

* Please write a test for your change.
* Ensure that you didn't break the build by running `./mvnw verify -Dgpg.skip`.
* Fork the repo and create a pull request. (See
[Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html))

The basic coding style is described in the
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file `.editorconfig`.

Jersey Micrometer supports [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for continuous
integration. Your pull request will be automatically build by Travis CI.
