# Jersey Micrometer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer)

Jersey Micrometer uses [Jersey 1](https://jersey.java.net/),
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) and
[Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) to simplify gathering metrics for your
JAX-RS resource methods.

Jersey Micrometer is published under the
[Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
It requires at least Java 8.

Jersey Micrometer is a based on [Marshall Pierce](https://mpierce.org/)'s
[jersey-metrics-filter](https://github.com/palominolabs/jersey-metrics-filter)
library which uses [Metrics](https://metrics.dropwizard.io) instead of
Micrometer.


## Installation

Jersey Micrometer is available from
[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|jersey-micrometer).

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.stefanbirkner</groupId>
      <artifactId>jersey-micrometer</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>


## Usage

If you have a resource class like this:

    @Path("whatever")
    public class SomeResource {
        @GET
        public String get() {
            return "some data";
        }
    }

then by using this library you will get a
[Timer](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_timers) metric generated for the
`get()` method. The timers have two tags:
- `method` contains the HTTP method
- `status` contains the response's status code
- `uri` contains the request path

In this example a timer with the name `http.server.requests` is used. Its tag
`method` has the value `GET`, the tag `status` has the value `200` and the tag
`uri` has the value `/whatever`.

### Installation

The first step is to add this library's module and its prerequisites.
- `ResourceMethodMicrometerModule` is the module for this library.
- `ResourceMethodWrappedDispatchModule` is needed so that method invocation
metrics can be captured without resorting to thread locals or other such
unpleasantness.
- We also bind a MeterRegistry instance. The binding uses a binding annotation
because it's impolite for a library to insist on an un-qualified binding of a
common type like MeterRegistry. This MeterRegistry instance is what will be used
to house all metrics generated by the library.

```
// in your Guice module
@Override
protected void configure() {
    install(new ResourceMethodMicrometerModule());

    // required for resource method metrics
    install(new ResourceMethodWrappedDispatchModule());

    MetricRegistry registry = new SimpleMeterRegistry();
    bind(MeterRegistry.class).annotatedWith(JerseyResourceMicrometer.class).toInstance(registry);

    ...
```

### Configuration

By default metrics are collected for every resource method. You can change this
behavior to not collecting metrics by default. Therefore you have to bind an
instance of the
[Configuration](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/jersey-micrometer-filter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/stefanbirkner/micrometer/jersey/Configuration.java)
class where metrics are disabled by default.

    bind(Configuration.class)
        .toInstance(new Configuration().disabledByDefault());

You can override the default behavior by adding the annotation
`@ResourceMetrics` to a class or method.

    @Path("somewhere")
    public class SomeResource {
        @GET
        @ResourceMetrics
        public String get() {
            return "ok";
        }
    }

enables metrics collection for the method while

    @Path("somewhere")
    @ResourceMetrics
    public class SomeResource {
        @GET
        public String get() {
            return "ok";
        }
    }

enables metrics collection for all methods of the class. You can disable metric
collection by setting the annotation's `enabled` flag to `false`

    @ResourceMetrics(enabled = false)

If the annotation is present at a method and its class then the annotation at
the method has precedence.


## Development Guide

Jersey Micrometer is build with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). If you want
to contribute code then

* Please write a test for your change.
* Ensure that you didn't break the build by running `./mvnw verify -Dgpg.skip`.
* Fork the repo and create a pull request. (See
[Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html))

The basic coding style is described in the
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file `.editorconfig`.

Jersey Micrometer supports [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for continuous
integration. Your pull request will be automatically build by Travis CI.


## Release Guide

* Select a new version according to the
  [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Standard](http://semver.org/).
* Set the new version in `pom.xml` and in the `Installation` section of
  this readme.
* Commit the modified `pom.xml` and `README.md`.
* Run `./mvnw clean deploy` with JDK 8.
* Add a tag for the release: `git tag jersey-micrometer-X.X.X`
